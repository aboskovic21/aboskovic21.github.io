	<p>I'm a PhD student in the <a href="https://stat.uw.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/">Jon Wakefield</a>. My research here is generously supported by the <a href="http://ndseg.sysplus.com/">DoD NDSEG Fellowship</a>.</p>
	<p>I'm currently working on survey methodology and spatio-temporal modeling of mortality in low- and middle-income countries. I previously studied optimal resource allocation and methods for imbalanced data classification during undergrad at Amherst College.</p>
