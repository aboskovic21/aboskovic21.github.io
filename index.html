	<p>I'm graduating with a masters degree from the <a href="https://stat.uw.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at the University of Washington in December 2024, advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/">Jon Wakefield</a>. My research here was generously supported by the <a href="http://ndseg.sysplus.com/">DoD NDSEG Fellowship</a>. I've worked on survey methodology and spatio-temporal modeling of mortality in low- and middle-income countries, and I've previously studied optimal resource allocation and methods for imbalanced data classification during undergrad at Amherst College.</p>
