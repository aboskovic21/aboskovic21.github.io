# Tidy Tuesday March 3, 2021: World COVID-19 Vaccinations

This week with RLadies, we looked at [vaccinations data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations). There were a few datasets in the repo, but we thought that it would be interesting to check out what total COVID-19 vaccinations look like around the world.

The hardest part of this week was figuring out which vaccination statistics we wanted to look at because the dataset included median vaccination rate and other vaccination rate information.
