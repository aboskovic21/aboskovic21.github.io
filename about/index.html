	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I live in Seattle, and in my free time, I love trail running and riding my bike. When I'm not brave enough to face the rain, you'll probably find me at the SIFF, reading to prepare for my weekly book club with my friends, or working on a passion project. I spend lots of time with my cat, Frki, who is a great coding buddy!</p>
