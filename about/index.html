	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I'm a first year PhD student in the University of Washington Department of Statistics, and I graduated from Amherst College as a mathematics and statistics major. My research interests are broadly in survey methodology, uncertainty quantification, and spatio-temporal modeling. In my free time, I love running, riding my bike, and listening to music. </p>
	
	<p>I spend lots of time with my cat, Frki, who is a great coding buddy!</p>
