	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I'm a first year PhD student in the University of Washington Department of Statistics, and I graduated from Amherst College as a mathematics and statistics major. My research interests are broadly in machine learning and modeling. In my free time, I love running, reading, and listening to music. Some of my favorite artists are The Beatles, Amy Winehouse, and Bon Iver, and this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4oftjl6M4We9cMNHQgzZwg?si=UmZODpUaSbenhDzZT8fuEg">short playlist</a> includes a few of my favorite songs.</p>
	
	<p>Originally, I'm from Bosnia and Herzegovina, but I've spent most of my life in Connecticut. I spend lots of time with my cat, Frki, who is a great coding buddy!</p>
